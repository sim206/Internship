<h1>Designing a tensile benchtop test in collaboration with Residual stress measurement with the laser ultrasonic method</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this paper, the design of a small-scale hydraulic tensile benchtop test rig in collaboration with residual stress measurement using the laser ultrasonic method was discussed. Two designs were proposed: Design 1, a standard mechanical rig, and Design 2, a hydraulic rig. The cost and materials for each design were provided.

Based on the discussion and analysis, it was determined that Design 2, the hydraulic rig, was a more suitable and simplified option for the experimental setup. However, further modifications and improvements are needed to account for the weight of adjustable plates and potential bending forces. Finite element analysis can be conducted to evaluate the effects and optimize the rig design.

An initial lab trial was conducted using the laser ultrasonic method to measure residual stress. The experimental setup and methodology were described, and the results showed a decrease in longitudinal and shear wave velocities as the load was applied to the sample. The results supported the detectability of residual stress using the laser ultrasonic method.

Future work should focus on refining the rig design, conducting further experiments with different materials and stress levels, and validating the results through comparison with other established residual stress measurement methods. Additionally, efforts can be made to automate the data analysis process using advanced algorithms and software tools.

Overall, the combination of the hydraulic tensile benchtop test rig and laser ultrasonic method for residual stress measurement holds great potential for evaluating the structural integrity of materials and components. It can contribute to improved design processes and better understanding of the effects of residual stress on material behavior..

**Design 2: Hydraulic Rig**

The following design is a modified version of design 1; the main difference is how the load is applied. This design consists of three notched shafts and two triangular adjustable plates. The plates are moved vertically by the three cylinders that are mounted onto the tension or compression plates depending on the operatorsâ€™ requirements. The hydraulic system is based on a single-acting piston that moves the plates, thus is a manually operated system. The operator would need to bleed the hydraulic pump to adjust the pressure and control the rate of loading.

Summary:

Design 1: Expensive and didn't meet experimental setup requirements.
Design 2: Simplified hydraulic rig but didn't consider adjustable plate weight.
Design 3: Improved version, accounting for bending force and potential rig modifications.

Overall, these designs allow for better experiment customization without permanent sample deformation.
